A little while ago I registered the domain transgirl.fr[1], mostly for fun but also because I wanted a separate domain to host some public services on, in the vein of catgirl.cloud, private.coffee, projectsegfau.lt and many others.

A sizable fraction of web content filtering systems have classified transgirl.fr as porn and blocked it.

Oops, my bad, I forgot, us trans women can't have nice things, all we're good for is being degradingly fetishized -- oh except of course when we're to blame for *checks notes* everything from misogyny to child abuse[2]. ~~Scapegoating is straight out of the fascist playbook, but that's a conversation for another day.~~

I did actually wonder before registering the domain if something like this would be an issue. But when I asked one of my trans friends whether she thought transgirl.fr sounded like a porn site, she quite rightly responded that it didn't matter, because not registering it on that basis would be *letting those captitalising on fetishisation win*.

=> ./legal.gmi Incorrect legal analysis (because I was missing information)

EDIT: Cadence[5] swiftly pointed out that according to the Internet Archive, the previous owner of the domain did actually host porn on it, and thatâ€™s probably why itâ€™s been blocked. Which makes this a somewhat less interesting post than I had hoped. Oops. Well, not the first or last time Iâ€™ve been wrong on the internet.

Does this mean the world is less fucked up, because content filters arenâ€™t quite as discriminatory, or more fucked up, because a trans girl canâ€™t register a cool domain name without worrying about whether it used to have fetish porn on it? You decide.

1: .fr is technically for France, but in this context should be read as "for real" (something something english person erasing the french)
2: this is SARCASM. I have never done anything wrong and I never will ðŸ˜‡ [3]
3: this is ALSO SARCASM, but I do limit myself to victimless crimes ðŸ˜‡ [4]
4: this is plausibly sarcasm and should not be used against me in court

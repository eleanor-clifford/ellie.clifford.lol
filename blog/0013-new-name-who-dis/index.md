Wow, it's been over a year since I last posted here!

Anyway, this is my coming-out post 🏳️‍⚧️. I now use she/her and go
by Eleanor, or Ellie, or Ell, or really whatever you like that's derived from my
real name and not my deadname \^w\^

More posts coming soon! (A big part of the whole "not posting" thing was that I
didn't want to post under my deadname but wasn't ready to come out yet, so,
yeah)

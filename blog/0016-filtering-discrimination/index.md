A little while ago I registered the domain
[transgirl.fr](https://transgirl.fr)<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, mostly for fun but also because I
wanted a separate domain to host some public services on, in the vein of
[catgirl.cloud](https://catgirl.cloud),
[private.coffee](https://private.coffee),
[projectsegfau.lt](https://projectsegfau.lt/) and many others.

A sizable fraction of web content filtering systems have classified
transgirl.fr as porn and blocked it.

Oops, my bad, I forgot, us trans women can't have nice things, all we're good
for is being degradingly fetishized -- oh except of course when we're to blame
for [*checks notes*]{.small} everything from misogyny to child
abuse<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. ~~Scapegoating is straight out of the
fascist playbook, but that's a conversation for another day.~~

I did actually wonder before registering the domain if something like this
would be an issue. But when I asked one of my trans friends whether she thought
transgirl.fr sounded like a porn site, she quite rightly responded that it
didn't matter, because not registering it on that basis would be *letting those
captitalising on fetishisation win*.

<summary>Incorrect legal analysis (because I was missing information)</summary>
<div class="content">

But I really didn't think that it would be this bad. As is, there is a strong
argument that this filtering is actually illegal in the UK -- the filter has no
evidence that transgirl.fr should be blocked other than the reference to a
trans person, and "Gender reassignment" is a protected characteristic under the
Equality Act 2010.

Even the argument that these filters are just statistical systems, and in the
real world "trans girl" is a phrase commonly associated with porn (and the
further stretch that this somehow absolves the designers of the system) falls
flat -- the Equality Act 2010 further protects against "indirect
discrimination", i.e. discrimination caused by systems that are applied equally
but put some people at a disadvantage based on a protected characteristic.

I'm not a lawyer, but any potential litigation would probably hinge on 2010
c.15 s.19 2.d: whether the web filtering designers can show their
discriminatory system to be "a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate
aim."

It's not.

EDIT: [Cadence](https://cadence.moe) swiftly pointed out that according to the
Internet Archive, the previous owner of the domain did actually host porn on
it, and that's probably why it's been blocked. Which makes this a somewhat less
interesting post than I had hoped. Oops. Well, not the first or last time I've
been wrong on the internet.

Does this mean the world is less fucked up, because content filters aren't
quite as discriminatory, or more fucked up, because a trans girl can't register
a cool domain name without worrying about whether it used to have fetish porn
on it? You decide.

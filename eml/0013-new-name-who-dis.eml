<p>Wow, it‚Äôs been over a year since I last posted here!</p>
<p>Anyway, this is my coming-out post üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è. I now use she/her and go by
Eleanor, or Ellie, or El, or really whatever you like that‚Äôs derived

<p>More posts coming soon! (A big part of the whole ‚Äúnot posting‚Äù thing
was that I didn‚Äôt want to post under my deadname but wasn‚Äôt ready to
come out yet, so, yeah)</p>

<p>A little while ago I registered the domain <a

id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, mostly for fun but also
because I wanted a separate domain to host some public services on, in
the vein of <a href="https://catgirl.cloud">catgirl.cloud</a>, <a
href="https://private.coffee">private.coffee</a>, <a
href="https://projectsegfau.lt/">projectsegfau.lt</a> and many
others.</p>
<p>A sizable fraction of web content filtering systems have classified
transgirl.fr as porn and blocked it.</p>
<p>Oops, my bad, I forgot, us trans women can‚Äôt have nice things, all
we‚Äôre good for is being degradingly fetishized ‚Äì oh except of course
when we‚Äôre to blame for <span class="small"><em>checks notes</em></span>
everything from misogyny to child
abuse<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. <del>Scapegoating is straight out
of the fascist playbook, but that‚Äôs a conversation for another
day.</del></p>
<p>I did actually wonder before registering the domain if something like
this would be an issue. But when I asked one of my trans friends whether
she thought transgirl.fr sounded like a porn site, she quite rightly
responded that it didn‚Äôt matter, because not registering it on that
basis would be <em>letting those captitalising on fetishisation
win</em>.</p>
<p>But I really didn‚Äôt think that it would be this bad. As is, there is
a strong argument that this filtering is actually illegal in the UK ‚Äì
the filter has no evidence that transgirl.fr should be blocked other
than the reference to a trans person, and ‚ÄúGender reassignment‚Äù is a
protected characteristic under the Equality Act 2010.</p>
<p>Even the argument that these filters are just statistical systems,
and in the real world ‚Äútrans girl‚Äù is a phrase commonly associated with
porn (and the further stretch that this somehow absolves the designers
of the system) falls flat ‚Äì the Equality Act 2010 further protects
against ‚Äúindirect discrimination‚Äù, i.e.¬†discrimination caused by systems
that are applied equally but put some people at a disadvantage based on
a protected characteristic.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not a lawyer, but any potential litigation would probably hinge
on 2010 c.15 s.19 2.d: whether the web filtering designers can show
their discriminatory system to be ‚Äúa proportionate means of achieving a

<p>It‚Äôs not.</p>

A little while ago I registered the domain transgirl.fr[1], mostly for fun but also because I wanted a separate domain to host some public services on, in the vein of catgirl.cloud, private.coffee, projectsegfau.lt and many others.

A sizable fraction of web content filtering systems have classified transgirl.fr as porn and blocked it.

Oops, my bad, I forgot, us trans women can't have nice things, all we're good for is being degradingly fetishized -- oh except of course when we're to blame for *checks notes* everything from misogyny to child abuse[2]. ~~Scapegoating is straight out of the fascist playbook, but that's a conversation for another day.~~

I did actually wonder before registering the domain if something like this would be an issue. But when I asked one of my trans friends whether she thought transgirl.fr sounded like a porn site, she quite rightly responded that it didn't matter, because not registering it on that basis would be *letting those captitalising on fetishisation win*.

But I really didn't think that it would be this bad. As is, there is a strong argument that this filtering is actually illegal in the UK -- the filter has no evidence that transgirl.fr should be blocked other than the reference to a trans person, and "Gender reassignment" is a protected characteristic under the Equality Act 2010.

Even the argument that these filters are just statistical systems, and in the real world "trans girl" is a phrase commonly associated with porn (and the further stretch that this somehow absolves the designers of the system) falls flat -- the Equality Act 2010 further protects against "indirect discrimination", i.e. discrimination caused by systems that are applied equally but put some people at a disadvantage based on a protected characteristic.

I'm not a lawyer, but any potential litigation would probably hinge on 2010 c.15 s.19 2.d: whether the web filtering designers can show their discriminatory system to be "a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim."

It's not.

1: .fr is technically for France, but in this context should be read as "for real" (something something english person erasing the french)
2: this is SARCASM. I have never done anything wrong and I never will üòá [3]
3: this is ALSO SARCASM, but I do limit myself to victimless crimes üòá [4]
4: this is plausibly sarcasm and should not be used against me in court

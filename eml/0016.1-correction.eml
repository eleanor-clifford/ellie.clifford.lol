Cadence[1] swiftly pointed out that according to the Internet Archive, the previous owner of transgirl.fr did actually host porn on it, and that's probably why it's been blocked. Which makes this a somewhat less interesting post than I had hoped. Oops. Well, not the first or last time I've been wrong on the internet.

Does this mean the world is less fucked up, because content filters aren't quite as discriminatory, or more fucked up, because a trans girl can't register a cool domain name without worrying about whether it used to have fetish porn on it? You decide.

<p>To me, the 6th of May will always be a day of conflicting
emotions.</p>
<p>On the 6th of May 1933, the Nazis raided and destroyed the Institut
für Sexualwissenschaft in Berlin, a home of pioneering queer and trans
research, medicine, art, and culture. Four days later, they burned its
entire collection—including countless irreplacable items and over a
decade of research into the same gender affirming care that today’s
fascists now claim is “new”. When the Allies finally came promising
liberation, they did not liberate my queer siblings.</p>
<p>They left them to rot.</p>

<p>On the 6th of May 2001, I took my first breath.</p>
<p>On the 6th of May 2025, as I watch my country’s politicians clamber
over each other in a race to see who can destroy my remaining human
rights the quickest, more than ever I think of 1933, and not of
2001.</p>

On the 6th of May 2001, I took my first breath.

On the 6th of May 2025, as I watch my country's politicians clamber over each other in a race to see who can destroy my remaining human rights the quickest, more than ever I think of 1933, and not of 2001.

Other things about me!

## Contact

I'm always happy to hear people's ideas and opinions about my stuff. Also just
if you want to send me something cool! No ads though of course.

**Matrix**: @ellie:clifford.lol

**Signal**: @ecc.73 (matrix is much preferred, note this is bridged there (with E2EE intact)

**Email**: ellie [at] clifford [dot] lol ([PGP key](https://ellie.clifford.lol/ellie_clifford.asc)).

## SRCF

I'm a sysadmin for the Student Run Computing Facility, a volunteer-run student
society that provides free, useful and flexible computing and network services
for University of Cambridge staff and students. See more
[here](https://www.srcf.net)

## Me in other places

Check out my Gemini site! If you don't know what Gemini is, it's a "smolnet"
alternative to the http/html ecosystem - leaner, meaner, and more wholesome.
You'll need a special browser to view it, then find me at
gemini://ellie.clifford.lol/ :)

You can also find me on SourceHut [here](https://git.sr.ht/~ecc), where my
active projects are hosted, or on GitHub
[here](https://github.com/eleanor-clifford), which hosts some forks of projects
I've contributed to.

Subject: On the proposed changes to the academic english training requirements of doctoral students</p>
<p>Dear [redacted],</p>
<p>I greatly appreciate the work that CfAE does. I have not found a need
to make use of it myself, but I do believe research communication is an
incredibly important skill, so championing it and teaching it is a very
worthwhile cause. That said, I would like to present a number of reasons
why I oppose the proposed extension of the requirement to all
students.</p>
<p>Firstly, and this is primarily a semantic issue, it took me a number
of readings to understand what the proposed reforms actually were. I do
not believe this to be a sign that I should take a CfAE course, but
rather that it stems from the sentence, “Assessment 1 will be replaced
with a research communication training and feedback <em>opportunity</em>
for all doctoral students” (emphasis mine). After getting halfway
through the questionnaire, I realised from the phrasing of a question
that you don’t actually mean “opportunity” at all, you mean requirement.
After all, an opportunity is only an opportunity if taking it is a
choice. I fear this phrasing will skew your survey results in a
direction that is unrepresentative of students’ real views.</p>
<p>Secondly, I think making this a requirement for <em>any</em> student
is a bad decision, let alone for all. The way I see it, when choosing
PhD students Imperial requires (or should require) a certain level of
general competence, and part of that is the ability to recognise our own
shortcomings and decide for ourselves what actions to take or not take
to improve them. We are not rowdy schoolchildren who need to be
corralled by force into making good decisions, we are adults, some of us
already a significant way through our research careers. Certainly, some
external constructive criticism is warranted to prompt self-reflection,
but that is part of the role of the supervisor – they have a direct
connection to the student, and are best placed to encourage (or even, in
rare cases, require) the students to do courses like this. In contrast,
I find a mandate from on high like this to be out of touch and frankly
patronising.</p>
<p>Thirdly, if there is a “risk of students only realising at the
writing-up stage how they could have benefitted from CfAE training and
feedback”, which there may well be, then what needs to be done is to
provide their <em>supervisors</em> with training, because in those cases
it is my belief that the supervisor has failed in their responsibility
to recognise the student’s shortcomings and direct them to useful help.
I don’t believe this is CfAE’s responsibility to judge. Even if the
proposed course did indeed end up only taking 30 minutes for a very
competent student, it would still be adding to an ever growing pile of
putatively formative assessments before the Early Stage Assessment: the
Initial Research Plan, the Risk Assessment Foundation Training, the
Plagiarism Awareness Course, and now this.</p>
<p>I think your proposal is <em>almost</em> a great one. A short
self-diagnostic for people who think they might need it is a great idea.
Expanding the personalised training to anyone who wants it is fantastic.
But I firmly believe that no part of this should be a requirement.</p>
<p>Many Thanks,<br> Eleanor Clifford, 2nd year PhD student in EEE</p>

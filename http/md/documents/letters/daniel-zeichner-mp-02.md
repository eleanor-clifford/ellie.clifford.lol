Subject: My rights under the ECHR have been violated. As my MP, will you stand up for me?

Dear Daniel Zeichner,

I write to you as your constituent, but also as a woman who is shocked and afraid, a woman who has been forced to watch as her fundamental human rights are steadily dismantled. Our continuing trajectory as a country has now become so bleak that I have had to begin preparing contingency plans to flee elsewhere in Europe.

As you will be aware, the Supreme Court recently adjudicated that despite the Gender Recognition Act 2004 (GRA2004) clearly stating that a trans women's "sex becomes that of a woman" "for all purposes" when a Gender Recognition Certificate is issued, the Equality Act 2010 somehow simply ignores this and implicitly imposes it's own incompatible definition, nullifying major parts of the GRA2004. Following this, your government and the so-called Equality and Human Rights Commission issued further trans-exclusionary guidance beyond even that required by the ruling, such as a full and seemingly mandatory bathroom ban. Meanwhile, Metropolitan Police guidance now suggests that when I travel to London to peacefully protest, I run the risk of being subjected to sexual assault by a man with impunity, under the guise of a strip search.

As you will also be aware, the GRA2004 was enacted as a result of the UK being found in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in 2002. As the GRA2004 is undone, the UK is in violation once again. If I need to use the bathroom in public, new guidance suggests I be forced to "out" myself as trans by using a bathroom that does not match my appearance. Not only does this violate Article 8 of the ECHR, the "right to respect for private and family life", but it puts me at even higher risk of violence. And it's not just trans women like me -- cis women are now at risk of being harassed and "transvestigated" in the bathroom if they are gender non-conforming, and trans men risk being accused of predatory behaviour if they comply with the law, since of course most look just like cis men.

It's not even just Article 8. The Supreme Court refused to listen to any trans people in their proceedings despite the profound implications their ruling would have on our lives, squarely violating Article 6 of the ECHR, the "right to a fair trial". Article 11, the "right to freedom of association", is also put in question by the seemingly mandatory nature of the bathroom ban.

The Supreme Court may have the power to interpret legislation, but it is members of Parliament like you who have the power to create and amend it. Your website describes you as "standing up for Cambridge". Will you use this power to stand up for the human rights of your constituents? Or will you simply sit back and do nothing?

I hope you will take the right path, because my life and my future may well depend on it.</p>

Dear Eleanor,<br>
<br>
I hope you are keeping well. Thank you for getting in touch with me regarding your detailed views regarding the recent Supreme Court ruling and trans rights.&nbsp;I take all feedback received from my constituents very seriously, and I am grateful to you for taking the time to share your views with me, especially as a trans woman.<br>
<br>
I deeply appreciate the time which you have taken to express your perspective on the current law and guidance. As you are aware, on 16 April, the Supreme Court ruled that sex in the Equality Act means biological sex, meaning a person will be considered as their biological sex for the purposes of the Act, whether they have a Gender Recognition Certificate or not. While the Supreme Court was clear about the importance of biological sex, it also stressed that trans people do retain clear protections in law and should be able to live their lives free of harassment and discrimination.<br>
<br>
You will also know that the EHRC has since issued interim guidance.&nbsp;The EHRC is a non-departmental public body independent from the Government. I understand that the guidance has caused concern and certainty, especially to members of the trans community. The guidance remains under review by the Government and a consultation is expected to be launched in May.&nbsp;While I await further clarification over this, I would like to reassure you of my ongoing commitment to supporting the rights of&nbsp;trans people, women, people with protected characteristics, and the most vulnerable in our society.<br>
<br>
Thank you again for contacting me.<br>
<br>
Best wishes,<br>

Daniel Zeichner

Dear Daniel Zeichner,

Thank you very much for taking the time to reply. I have further things to say as a result of your response, but firstly, could I please request that we set up an urgent face-to-face meeting to continue this further? I believe there is a lot more to discuss, and that would be the best way to do it.

Secondly, may I please request that you do not use the phrase 'biological sex' to mean sex assigned at birth in the way that the Supreme Court has? I believe it is of material importance in this matter that we call things what they are, and as the British Medical Association's resident doctors conference recently described it, this definition of 'biological sex' is 'reductive, trans and intersex-exclusionary, and biologically nonsensical'. After all, the purpose of gender-affirming care is to modify attributes of biological sex! And it certainly does its job -- I am a living, breathing, biological woman, and that will only become more true as time goes on. To deny that, as the resident doctors put it, 'has no basis in science or medicine'.

Thirdly, In line with your commitment to supporting the rights of trans people, along with cisgender women and others, I would like to lay out some concrete actions I would like you to take. I hope we can discuss these further in person if you are not already convinced.

1. Urgently contact Bridget Phillipson MP, the Minister for Women and Equalities, asking her to rescind her comments suggesting trans people should use facilities corresponding to their sex assigned at birth, pointing out that the Supreme Court did not require this, and explaining that it would violate Article 8 of the ECHR and create a legal and societal disaster for the Government.

2. Please further urge the Minister for Women and Equalities to solicit opinions and guidance directly from other legal entities, in particular trans-led organisations, and not just the EHRC. As you point out, the EHRC is a non-Governmental body; the Government is not required to make their guidance statutory. In fact, the EHRC cannot be considered to be impartial or balanced at all: the United Nations Independent Expert on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity described in 2023 the EHRC's actions relating to trans human rights as 'wholly unbecoming of an institution created to “stand up for those in need of protection and hold governments to account for their human rights obligations”'

2. If the interim EHRC guidance is brought before parliament, put down a Prayer Motion to stop the clock until the EHRC actually engages with the trans community, as the Supreme Court did not do, and as a mere 2 weeks of consultation will not be nearly enough time to do.

3. Speak out for trans people, in parliament and in public, disavowing the 'biological sex' framing and challenging MPs and media figures who openly engage in harassment against trans people in their rhetoric, despite us supposedly, as you put it, 'retain[ing] clear protections in law'.

4. Vote against amendment NC21 of the Data Bill, and any future motions like it, which flies in the face of the ECHR even more than the Supreme court and the EHRC already have.

Thank you again for taking the time to reply, and I hope we are able to meet face-to-face soon.

Many Thanks,
Eleanor</p>
